    <h2>Topic:</h2>
    <p>
      Our idea for the final project would be to create a website catered
      towards the jazz community or people who wish to gain more information on
      jazz. We would include multiple pages including info about history,
      current popularity, genre, notable artists, standards and alternate
      arrangements, classics, and a local event finder page. For our home page,
      we would include a description of why jazz is important, about the
      community, fun facts, how and why one should discover more jazz, include
      references for movies and documentaries about jazz, and include Spotify
      and Youtube API’s. <br />For our history page, we will showcase the
      earliest forms of jazz, its evolution, and important historical events.
      External links and info would be included, either through our own HTML or
      fetched via several APIs that we will be researching. The freedom and
      improvisation incorporated into the legacy of the jazz genre has allowed
      for an incredible number of sub-genres to be created and defined. We plan
      to cover important sub-genres and their history on a genre page that will
      link with the history page. This genre page will include information about
      how these subgenres came to be, when they were at their peak production,
      why they were created, and major differences between other subgenres.
      <br />
      Another page we will have will be a notable artists page, with popular,
      iconic, and classic artists that have contributed to jazz. This page will
      include API’s, links, etc. that will help our viewers learn and digest
      information. We will have many sub pages within each of these pages, but
      those have yet to be planned out. In order to facilitate that
      interactivity, we will also include a page that will teach a musically
      inclined user how to understand and play from “lead sheets” (sheet music
      for jazz, in this context), and this page will include an interactive
      form-based game that will test the user on their knowledge acquired.
      <br />
      Lastly, we will have an event finder page, with API’s that help people on
      the website locate live performances and events for jazz in their
      vicinity, which they could attend to further engage them with the strange
      and wonderful jazz art-form. Overall our goal is to create a rich,
      interactive website that helps users discover and appreciate jazz music in
      a comprehensive way.
